# ConvertingTemps_py
# first ask the user for the unit of measurement. So, either F or C.
# then caclculate the Fahrenheit and display if the user selects C and inputs a floating number for that after.

# and vice-versas if the user picks F, and inputs a floating number. Next give the user that temp in Celsius.
# this will simply utilize if, else if, and else control flow logic.
